# MVM Missions

All of the TF2 MvM Missions i've made, finished and unfinished. All custom robot icons used is from [Potato's asset pack](https://github.com/potato-tf/ArchiveAssets).

## Background

All missions i've made was for [Potato MvM Servers](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/potatomvmservers), way back in 2016 when group was not well known.
Later i've lost my intrest on MvM and effectly left the team before group becomes a lot more bigger. All missions in this repository has been updated for custom robot icons that were lost after many years.

## Missions

#### Trainyard

I've created a MvM map, [Trainyard](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1160890619).
This repository contains an example mission for creators, and 2 offical missions, normal and advanced.

#### Advanced42

I've somewhat attempted to create a series of missions for each valve maps. These missions have a lot of custom robots with very little robots made by valve.
None of these missions have an offical name, it was named "CustomRobotMision" before I changed to "advanced42" just to make it more obvious that it's an advanced mission made by myself.
These missions are generaly more longer than typical valve's missions.
These include:
- mvm_mannhattan
- mvm_rottenburg
- mvm_coaltown (unfinished)

#### Ghost Town 1337

One mission for mvm_ghost_town. It's like wave 666, but contains exactly 1337 robots, and lasts a lot more longer. I don't remember if it was an enjoyable mission.
